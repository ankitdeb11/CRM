//regarding types of reports:
there are only four types of reports: tabular, summary, matrix and joined.

for mailing list: we have to choose tabular report

A matrix report format is used when there is a need to group data by rows and columns 

A tabular report is a simple list of records with selected columns and is similar to a spreadsheet 

a joined report gives us an idea about the data and allows us to show data that share a relationship with one or more objects

- a user can refresh the dashboard on demand by clicking the refrehs button
- After a scheduled dashboard refresh, it can be emailed automatically to a group of users
