- accounts is an object in nav bar
- we can create records of our own, 13 records are pre-written
- we can set our own theme in salesforce, even for each of our application records;
- we have created our own platform by our email and I am the only owner here
if we have people who are wiling to collaborate in our project, we can give them access thru Users in quick find
