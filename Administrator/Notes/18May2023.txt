- after creating field only roll No is given, before ones are ignored(possible dev)
- for mandatory purposes in fields, we have to check the box of Required while creation
- inline edit option: we can edit the fields which were missed out before creation of new fields

- picklist and multipicklist
- global pick list value
- PickList value sets: create a Label, 
- create the global value picklist set and then setup global piclist and enable it for the field
- fields need to be unique
