lookup relationship
accounts and contacts relationship?
Recycle bin in app launcher
App creation app manager in setuppage




we will see profile creation today

while creating a user, assigning profile is mandatory


accountant, security guards, professors or teachers, 
policies will be different for each profile


profile: baseline permission given to a user to objects and applications(important question)

baseline permissions: create, write, edit, delete

where we can 

setup page

go to quick find and search profiles

we cannot create a profile
but we can clone profiles but we wont be able to create them

due to licenses, 

we can check licenses thru compan information
if we take subscription and increase our licenses, we can attemp to create profiles
right now our licenses dont allow us to craete profiles


salesform platform user has 3 licences



creating a salesforce platform user, 1 out of 3 licenses
salesfrom platform

customize the access powers of ur crated profile : vit manager
in setup and allow permissions

gave permission in custom object permissions
read, creat, edit, delete, modify all, view all


by clicking active button, we can enable login button

we cannot see other apps in ramesh because he has access only in vit management app but not other apps

we can enable login access poilicy and enable it 


ramesh and suresh are having same profiles vit manager

we can give extra permissions to suresh

for providing extra access to users: if we want to give access to the user for objects and applications and we have permission sets. 

permission sets: they are granting extra access to Users individually 


-> if we want to give some extra access to the user for objects and applications without any change in baseline permissions of profile then we create permission sets and assign it to the User

(very very important question)

we assign permission sets to Users only, not to profiles
setup page> then permission sets > tehn transport permission


we can create master detail from custom to standard
