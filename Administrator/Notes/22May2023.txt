- Field dependencies
- 

go for student object, 
we have fields there, branch is having picklist
for auto numbers, click on Rollno and edit it


due to needs, we wish to change from auto number to another data type
changing it to picklist, field label changing it to reg numbers
creating values for the piclist such as CSE and ECE and MEC

now we will try to create field dependencies

objects, then fields and relationships, then field dependencies, new button
control fields and dependent field

control fields are main fields
from control fields we can take care of dependent fields

if u missed adding any pick list value, go to ur picklist and then click on edit
go to regNo, then simply go there, find values, click on New

if u wish to change the order, click on re-Order
 as per ur requirement

we can also check previews

if we wish to change the layout of our new records creation, we can customize it with the help of page layouts

for each customization, go to setup page
go to to student object
go to page layouts


field dependencies
they are filters that allows us to change the contents of a picklist based on the values of anotehr field

dependent field
controlled field

dependent field is limited to just 1 time, for any controlled field
but control fields can be more

if it is global picklist, the dependent field might be shown more than 1 time

learn about relationships now


realtionships
look up realtionships
master detail relationships

important Q: what is the relationship between accounts and contacts

accounts and contacts is under look up relationship
but cascade = true


master is nothing but parent and detail is nothing but child

parent child relationship

we cant create master detailed relationship in standard object
why we create relationships between two c objects:
if the student is having some faculty, so faculty should be assigned
so that's the reason we are having relationships


another 
point: in master detailed relationship, if we delete a record in parent, the record in child object also will be deleted
this is the meaning of cascade true


student is the detailed object
faculty is the master object



the field which we are giving relationship to is master object
the object where we are creating field is detail



go to setup page
give realtionship between custom objects


for creating records with new relationships, make sure we delete the old records


field name as assigned faculty

error: https://prnt.sc/oPDzg6iDwVvw
convert our look up fields and then change to master detailed relationship


improve as a dev: create delete all records option


related list label means assigned faculty
go for save

already existing records were there, so it was not allowing us to create master detailed relationship

have deleted in 


mai point is what is the relationship between accounts and contacts
look up rlntship but cascade=true, and it's a special relationship


if we delete a record in parent, the record in child object also be deleted and vice versa

object manager, students, fields and realtionshps, then go for New
important point: we can only create only 2 master detailed reltionships for 1 object



go for mech, then go to related, 


field realtionships
relationships in salesforce
