//Notes on 23 May 2023

yesterday we have discussed:
field dependencies
master-detail relationship

today we will create a new application

2nd point = tightly coupled realtionship because master is realted to detail, they depend on each other
- accounts and contacts, important realtionship
- since relationship is look up relationship, and cascade=true
- so if we delete a record in contacts, it will not be deleted vice versa wise
- master detailed relationship can be for 2 times

// look up relationship
- is a kind of losely coupled relationship


- 2nd point: as in master detail, cascade = true
- it doesn't affect the relationships between 2 objects
- no record is deleted in the relationship of objects
- no effect of record deletion between objects
cascade = false here



important Question: where is recycle bin, it is found in app launcher


// for relationships, we will go to setup page
- look up relationships can be created 40 times
- for master-detail is 2
- for an object
- in look up relationship, we have required option to select
- related list label


if we have made look up relationship in same object which had master, we have to delete all the master detailed relationship first and then see for look ups

student and faculty new relationship is created, look up one


where we can find recycle bin in salesforce platform: 

app creation in salesforce:
setup page, go to app manager in quick find, new lightning app, 

standard applications are already inbuilt


navigationstyle
standard nav and console nav



classic version has only desktop
lightning has both such as dekstop and phone

utility items are like the cahtter fields, notes, rich text

we can add objects while creating new application


transport doesn't come because it didn't have tab option

compulsary we have to select profiles, system admin must be made, it doesnt come by default


if u want to edit the app, go to app manager in home through quick find
click on edit


app manager manages all the applications, we can customize everything there
