// Notes for 19th May 2023

Ways to create Objects: 
- we can create using Data Import Wizard, for creating objects
-creat custom from spread sheet, that's the wizard
- 2nd way, we can create using Schema Builder
- Schema Builder is like a graph kind of thing-
top left we have objects, we can scroll down, under Elements in Schema Builder

- we can create relationships in schema builder
-account has relationship with contact(standard objects)
- since there is no include tab option in shcema builder objetc, so it was not visible in nav bar
setup page, then object manager, then schema builder, 

created by, last modified by, owner, label name: 4 default fields

- elements in schema builder, we can create fields from there

- Always required is for mandatory fields, interview Qs
- once we create fields in any part either from schema builder or custom object, all will be visible
- when we create our fields, when we put data in it, it's called records
example: shiva
tranport was our new object
